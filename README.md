# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Project

In this project, we try to implement a Twitter sentiment analysis model that helps to identify the positive or negative sentiments of the tweets.
We used NLTK, Naive Bayes Classifer to classify sentiments of the tweets, and deployed the model on web application using Flask.
